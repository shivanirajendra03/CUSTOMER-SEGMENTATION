# CUSTOMER-SEGMENTATION
Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering â€” a simple data science project demonstrating how to group customers based on age, income, and spending score using Python and scikit-learn.

Project Overview
Customer segmentation is a key marketing strategy that allows businesses to target specific groups of customers more effectively.  
In this example, a small dataset is created and analyzed using **K-Means Clustering**, a popular **unsupervised machine learning** algorithm.

Features
- Data preprocessing using pandas 
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler  
- Customer clustering using K-Means from scikit-learn  
- Visualization using matplotlib

 Dataset
A sample dataset of 10 customers is used with the following attributes:
- CustomerID
- Age
- Annual_Income(k$)
- Spending_Score(1-100)
You can replace this with a larger or real dataset for more insights.

Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

Visualization
The results are visualized using a scatter plot that shows customer clusters based on Annual Income and Spending Score
